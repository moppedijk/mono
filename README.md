Dont think. Build.

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve landing`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Best practices
- Code needs to be predictable
- Code needs to be configurable
- It needs to be simple
- It should be highly dynamic
- It should be easy to build new apps
- It should be easy to maintain multiple apps
- Libraries should be build to reuse
- Limit variables to a few options; small, default, large
- Use good defaults, things should work 'out of the box'
- Finish features before starting something new
- Always up to date
- One thing at a time

## Technology

All projects should be written in Typescript. To keep thing consistent.
