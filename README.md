# Mono

Dont think. Build.

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve landing`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Best practices
- Code needs to be predictable
- Code needs to be configurable
- It needs to be simple
- It should be highly dynamic
- It should be easy to build new apps
- It should be easy to maintain multiple apps
- Libraries should be build to reuse
- Limit variables to a few options; small, default, large
- Use good defaults, things should work 'out of the box'
- Finish features before starting something new
- Always up to date
- One thing at a time
- If you reuse it make it reusable; don't over engineer

## Technology

All projects should be written in Typescript. To keep thing consistent.

## Environment
- Server environment variables can be found in .env
- Client environment variables can be found in environment files

## Todo
- English version
- Add unit tests
- Add e2e tests
- Create mock api endoint
- Floating footer bug
- Add detailed logging to api
- Add proper error handling in api
- Rename projects to moppedijk, and moppedijk-api
- Add design tokens structure with primitives, semantic, and component
- Consider renaming ui-common to ui-components
- Consider renaming ui-base to ui-foundation

## Chores
- Update dependencies
